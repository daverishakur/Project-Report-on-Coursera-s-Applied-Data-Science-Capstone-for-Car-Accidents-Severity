    "A Road Traffic Accident according to Garber (2010) is a random event involving a road user that results into property damage, death or injury. Road Traffic Accidents(RTA) have become not just a National but a Global issue. It is on records that Road traffic accidents cause an estimated 13 million deaths and 20-50 million disabilities worldwide annually with 85% of injury related deaths occurring in developing countries. According to WHO (2007), RTA injuries accounted for 23% of all injury deaths worldwide. This project discusses the severity of car accidents citing City of Seattle. "
